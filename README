LuaUtils (luautils-0.1)
============================

This package is an add-on to the @HsLua@ package by Gracjan Polak (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslua).

HsLua only provides a very bare-bones wrapper over the Lua API, and this package is meant to fill in the gap by providing some commonly used features.

Currently the following features are provided -

1. @Lua.StackValue@ instances for a variety of commonly used datatypes, such as Lists, Tuples, Either, Maybe etc.
2. @luaDoString@ and @luaDoFile@ utility functions.
3. A way to dump the contents of the stack for debugging purposes.
